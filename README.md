# DappUniversity_SolidityExercises
These are Solidity exercises I've been practicing with Dapp University on YouTube. 

*Take these examples and copy/paste them onto remix.ethereum.org.
*Complie them using aa compilier version higher than 0.8.0
*Deploy the contracts & test them using the tolbar on the left-hand side with the variable buttons.

Thank you for viewing my repositiory!
